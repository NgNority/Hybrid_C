# Hybrid_C
This is a complete recode of the original Hybrid watchface. Its very early into development but, it functions.

**Beeg Update**
So... I finally managed to make it switch colors. Now you can customize some very basic features of the watch! You can change the color of the watchface and wether the battery bar shows or not another thing fixed is the hour hand which it now moves with the minute hand. Hope you enjoy!
